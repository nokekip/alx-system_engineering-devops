## Timeline
- **3:46 PM UTC:** Panic ensued as a developer noticed the website crashing with a 500 error after a WordPress update.
- **3:48 PM UTC:** The developer quickly checked processes, uncovering a glitch in **PHP/WordPress**.
- **3:50 PM UTC:** Acting fast, the developer activated debug mode in `/var/www/html/wp-config.php.`
